For the following problems, run this code to create `dog_data`:

```{r, message = FALSE}
dog_data <- read_csv("https://decisionslab.unl.edu/data/stevens_etal_2020_obed_data1.csv") %>%
  select(class, dog_sex, dias_overall_score, latency_sit_mean, starts_with("cort"))
```


**Problem 1: (4 pts)** Let's look at the distribution of the time that it took the dogs to sit after hearing the command (`latency_sit_means`). First, find the maximum latency and add 1 to get the total number of bins that we want in our histogram (there are latencies of 0, so we need an extra bin for them). Then create a histogram of the latency counts, with the area of all bars colored _steelblue1_ and the borders of the bars colored _steelblue_.

```{r}

```

\newpage

**Problem 2: (3 pts)** Adjust the `class` column to remove the _S18_ level and put the other levels in the following order: _U18_, _F18_, _S19_, _U19_, _F19_. Reassign the output to `dog_data`.

```{r}

```

**Problem 3: (3 pts)** Create a boxplot of `dias_overall_score` as a function of `class`, making the lines of the boxplot _grey60_. Then overlay the mean and standard error over the boxplot, using a ggplot function to calculate the mean and standard error.


```{r}

```

\newpage

**Problem 4: (8 pts)** Now make a violin plot of `dias_overall_score` as a function of `class`. Make the areas of the violins colored based on class and transparent at level 0.25 and make the borders _grey60_. Add the raw data points **under** the violins, make them _grey60_, but don't let them show up in the legend. Use a coordinate function to switch the axes.

```{r}

```

\newpage

**Problem 5: (4 pts)** Remove from the data observations when `dog_sex` is _NA_. Then create a bar plot where ggplot counts the number of observations for each class (do not pass the counts to ggplot---use a geom that calculates the counts). Plot this with `dog_sex` as groups with different colored areas and plot _Male_ and _Female_ side-by-side. _Note that U19 and F19 have only one sex in each, and they look a little funny. Don't worry about that._

```{r}

```

\newpage

**Problem 6: (5 pts)** Create a scatterplot of `cort3` and `cort4` where points are colored based on `dog_sex`. Assign _Female_ to color #E69F00 and _Male_ to #56B4E9 (NA can use the default color). Overlay a single, black linear regression line.


```{r}

```

\newpage

**Problem 7: (4 pts)** First run the following code to create a new data frame with dog id, dog sex, and two cort measurements.

```{r}
dog_cort <- dog_data %>% 
  mutate(id = 1:nrow(dog_data)) %>% 
  select(id, dog_sex, cort3, cort4) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(dog_sex) & !is.na(cort3) & !is.na(cort4))
```

Now reshape the data frame where `cort3` and `cort4` are rotated to long format with the name column called `time` and the values column called `cort`. Then create a slopegraph with `time` on the x axis, `cort` on the y axis, and lines connecting points based on `id`.

```{r}

```

## Literate programming

Literate programming allows us to include computer code into documents to allow sophisticated documentation of code and to generate reproducible results from data analysis. To do this, we write our documents in _plain text_, format the document with Markdown syntax, and insert R code into the document. Compile the code to integrate everything and produce a final, fully formatted document. This final document can be a manuscript, letter, web page, presentation, book, or other form of output. 

Here is what the process looks like:

`{knitr}` is an R package that takes R Markdown documents (`.Rmd`), processes the R code, and generates a regular Markdown document (`.md`). `pandoc` is a program that converts the Markdown document into one of many different kinds of files, including `.tex`, `.pdf`, `.html`, `.docx`, etc. 

## Markdown

### Syntax review

Markdown is a syntax that allow simple, human readable code for formatting documents. It is completely separate from R, so you can create Markdown documents without embedding R code and have them produce PDFs or HTML code. 

### Practice

Let's get some more practice writing the syntax that will format text.

```{r markdown-quiz}
quiz(
question_text(
  'Copy the example sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" and paste it into the text box below. Then add the Markdown syntax that will italicize the word *quick*.',
  placeholder = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
  answer('The *quick* brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', correct = TRUE),
  answer('The _quick_ brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', correct = TRUE),
  answer('The **quick** brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', message = "Oops, you bolded instead of italicized it."),
  answer('The __quick__ brown fox jumps over the lazy dog', message = "Oops, you bolded instead of italicized it."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question_text(
  'Copy the example sentence "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog" again and paste it into the text box below. Then add the Markdown syntax that will bold the word "dog".',
  placeholder = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog",
  answer('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy **dog**', correct = TRUE),
  answer('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy __dog__', correct = TRUE),
  answer('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy *dog*', message = "Oops, you italicized instead of bolded it."),
  answer('The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy _dog_', message = "Oops, you italicized instead of bolded it."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question(
  'Which of the following would be the correct way to code a second-level heading?',
  answer('`## My subheading`', correct = TRUE),
  answer('`2. My subheading`', message = "Oops, this would generate an ordered list."),
  answer('`#2 My subheading`'),
  answer('`2# My subheading`'),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question(
  'Which of the following would be the correct way to embed a link to the URL `https://unl.edu` for the word "UNL"?',
  answer('`[UNL](https://unl.edu)`', correct = TRUE),
  answer('`(UNL)[https://unl.edu]`'),
  answer('`(https://unl.edu)[UNL]`'),
  answer('`[https://unl.edu](UNL)`'),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
)
```


## Inline code

### Syntax review

R Markdown is a special form of Markdown that allows the embedding of R code into Markdown. R code can be embedded in two ways: inline code and code chunks.

Inline code means that the R code is embedded in the middle of a sentence. This allows you to effectively write formulas that will automatically insert sample sizes, measures of central tendency and uncertainty, and statistics directly in to your sentences.

To add inline code, you simply use the <code>&#96;r code&#96;</code> syntax, where you insert a single R command for the word `code`. For example, <code>&#96;r mean(myvector)&#96;</code> will insert the mean of the elements of `myvector`. But keep in mind that the default output includes a good number of digits, so you may need to round your output: e.g., <code>&#96;r round(mean(myvector), digits = 2)&#96;</code>.

R Markdown documents will fail to compile if the inline R code is incorrect, but the error messages are not always helpful in finding out what code is incorrect. So add inline code incrementally and compile frequently to check as you go. You can also test each individual inline code piece by highlighting the R syntax (without the <code>&#96;r &#96;</code> part) and pressing `Ctrl-Enter` to run the code in the console.

### Practice

```{r inline}
question("How would you write inline code to insert the object `my_bf` into a sentence?",
         answer("<code>The Bayes factor was &#96;r my_bf&#96;.</code>", correct = TRUE),
         answer("`The Bayes factor was 'r my_bf'.`"),
         answer('`The Bayes factor was "r my_bf".`'),
         answer("`The Bayes factor was (r my_bf).`"),
         allow_retry = TRUE,
         random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

## Code chunks

### Syntax review

Sometimes you need to run larger sections of code than a single R command. This is called a _code chunk_. Some R Markdown documents include all of the R code embedded in them, so there are a lot of code chunks. Other documents just source R scripts and use primarily inline code. 

Code chunks start with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}</code> followed by the code on a new line and end with <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code> on a new line:

<code>&#96;&#96;&#96;{r}<br>x <- 2 + 2<br>y <- 3 + 3<br>z <- x + y<br>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code>

You can control aspects of the chunk with options in the `{r}` component. You can name the code chunk for subsequent references (don't give two chunks the same name), and you can use arguments to control whether the chunk is evaluated (`eval`), whether the chunk's code is output to the document (`echo`), whether the chunk's results are output (`results`), and whether messages (`message`) or warnings (`warning`) are output. For example `{r fig1, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, results = TRUE, message = FALSE}` will name the chunk `fig1`, run the code, output the actual chunk code, output the results of the chunk, but suppress the messages produced by the chunks.

### Practice

```{r code-chunk-quiz}
quiz(
question(
  'Which of the following argument/value pairs would prevent the code chunk from running in R?',
  answer('`eval = FALSE`', correct = TRUE),
  answer('`echo = FALSE`', message = "The `echo` argument controls whether code is output."),
  answer('`results = FALSE`', message = "The `results` argument controls whether results are output."),
  answer('`message = FALSE`', message = "The `message` argument controls whether messages are output."),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question(
  'What would be output for a code chunk with the following argument/value pairs: `eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, results = FALSE, messages = TRUE`?',
  answer('Code and messages', correct = TRUE),
  answer('Code and results'),
  answer('Code only'),
  answer('Results only'),
  answer('Results and messages'),
  answer('Nothing'),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question(
  'What would be output for a code chunk with the following argument/value pairs: `eval = TRUE, echo = FALSE, results = TRUE, messages = TRUE`?',
  answer('Results and messages', correct = TRUE),
  answer('Code and results'),
  answer('Code only'),
  answer('Results only'),
  answer('Code and messages'),
  answer('Nothing'),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question(
  'In terms of _output_, what is the difference between these two sets of options: `eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE` and `eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE`?',
  answer('Nothing', correct = TRUE),
  answer('Only the first would output anything'),
  answer('Only the second would output anything'),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
),
question(
  'In terms of _computations_, what is the difference between these two sets of options: `eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE` and `eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE, message = FALSE`?',
  answer('Only the first would compute anything', correct = TRUE),
  answer('Nothing'),
  answer('Only the second would compute anything'),
  allow_retry = TRUE,
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
)
```
